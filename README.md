## ðŸ’« Overview 
A Node.js project demonstrating the use of Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database. This project showcases various Mongoose features, including schema definition, virtual properties, custom methods, middleware, and queries.

## ðŸª„ Features
1. Connects to a local MongoDB database using Mongoose
2. Defines a Product schema with the following features:
    - Virtual properties for calculating derived values
    - Custom instance methods for performing complex operations
    - Custom model methods for performing database operations
    - Middleware for executing pre- and post-save hooks
3. Demonstrates various Mongoose queries and syntax, including:
    - Finding documents by ID, name, and other criteria
    - Creating, updating, and deleting documents
    - Using virtual properties and custom methods

## ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository using `git clone`
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the application using `node product.js`
4. Explore the code and experiment with different Mongoose queries and syntax

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
